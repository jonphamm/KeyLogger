<h1>Keylogger Using Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A keylogger is a program that logs the keystrokes that a user makes on a computer. They can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Keyloggers are dangerous because they're difficult to detect and very effective at what they do.</p>
<p>This project involves the creation of a Keylogger using a scripting language known as Python. For the code editor, I will be using Visual Studio Code.</p>

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

<br>
We will use a Python library named pynput. This Python library lets you fully control and monitor keyboard and mouse inputs. Open up a terminal on your VS Code and install the pynput library by using the command below: <br/>
<br>
  
```
python -m pip install pynput
```

<br />
<br />
<br>
Now that we have installed the required Python library, import all the required packages.: <br/>
<br>
  
```
python -m pip install pynput
```

<br />
